# Solo Project — Interactive Front-End Application (Solo Version)

This is your individual version of the interactive front-end project.

You’ll build a small but real web application that:
- consumes at least one external API,
- responds to user input,
- and is deployed live on GitHub Pages.

This project prepares you for the group project and gives you a portfolio-ready piece that is fully your own work.

====================================================================
CORE REQUIREMENTS (SOLO)
====================================================================

Your project must meet the following minimum requirements:

1. Use at least ONE server-side API.
   Examples: iTunes Search API, OMDb, PokéAPI, TheMealDB, Jikan (anime), NASA APOD, OpenLibrary.

2. The app must be interactive.
   The user must type something, click something, or choose something, and the page updates with API data.

3. The layout must be visually readable and organized.
   Clear sections, readable font, consistent spacing.

4. Use semantic HTML whenever possible.
   Example: header, main, section, button.

5. Use custom CSS OR a CSS framework (your choice).
   A CSS framework is optional.

6. Show basic responsiveness.
   App should still be usable on a phone-sized viewport.

7. Deploy the application to GitHub Pages.

8. Include a README.md with:
   - project title
   - short description
   - technologies used
   - screenshot or GIF
   - link to deployed site

====================================================================
STRETCH GOALS (OPTIONAL)
====================================================================

These are not required but will impress reviewers or employers:

1. Use two APIs instead of one.

2. Add client-side storage (localStorage or sessionStorage).

3. Add a custom modal (not alert/prompt/confirm).

4. Add loading states and friendly error messages.

5. Improve accessibility (labels, focus states, ARIA attributes).

====================================================================
UPDATED SOLO PROJECT IDEAS (NON-WEATHER)
====================================================================

Here are fresh, realistic solo project ideas that avoid weather apps:

1. iTunes Music Search (Highly Recommended)
   Search an artist → list songs, album art, and optional audio previews.

2. Anime Character Search (Jikan API)
   Search anime or characters → show images, description, and metadata.

3. Movie Finder (OMDb or TMDB)
   Search a movie → display poster, year, plot, ratings.

4. Pokémon Stats Viewer (PokéAPI)
   Enter Pokémon name/ID → show sprite, type, and stats.

5. Recipe Finder by Ingredient (TheMealDB)
   Search ingredients → list recipes with thumbnails and instructions.

6. Random Space Photo Viewer (NASA APOD)
   Show today’s astronomy photo with title and explanation.
   Optional: Browse past dates.

7. Book Lookup Application (OpenLibrary)
   Search a book → show cover, author, publish year.

8. Emoji Meaning Finder (EmojiHub)
   Search a word → return matching emojis and their meanings.

9. Cocktail Finder (TheCocktailDB)
   Search cocktails by ingredient → show drink recipes and images.

10. Random Quote + Image Generator (AdviceSlip + Unsplash)
    Fetch a motivational quote + a background image based on keywords.

WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR
====================================================================

We are not grading for perfection. We care more about:

- Does the API fetch work?
- Does the UI update based on user interaction?
- Is the interface clear and usable?
- Is the code readable and organized?
- Did you deploy it successfully?

====================================================================
GRADING BREAKDOWN
====================================================================

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION — 40%
- Uses one API
- Displays API data
- No major runtime errors

UI / UX — 25%
- Clear layout
- Readable styling
- Basic responsiveness

CODE QUALITY — 20%
- Organized HTML/CSS/JS
- Semantic HTML where reasonable
- Comments and formatting

README & DEPLOYMENT — 15%
- GitHub Pages works
- README includes description, screenshot, live link

====================================================================
HOW TO SUBMIT
====================================================================

Submit the following:

- Live GitHub Pages URL
- GitHub repository URL

Make sure:
- README is complete
- App is deployed
- App runs without major errors
